# Overview
Using Verilog, we designed and implemented a digital displayer on a DE1-SOC FPGA board. This displayer shows a horizontal line with a vertical line centered in the middle of the horizontal line, allowing the vertical line to move either left or right in degrees by pressing switches. This is the final project by John and Dipesh for ECE 287 at Miami Unviersity. 
# Background
To complete out project, we first had to understand how to control the device ports on the DE1-SOC
